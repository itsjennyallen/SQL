/*
1. Write your own SQL query that uses a SELECT statement to order the items 
by price.

2.Write your own SQL query that will show a statistic about the item prices, 
like a sum, average, minimum, maximum, or count.

3. Write your own SQL query that will show a statistic about the price for items 
in the category of "Kitchen Supplies". 

4. Come up with your own question about the data and try to answer it using 
SQL. 
For example: How many air purifiers are in stock? It's okay if 
you can't figure out how to answer your question, 
the idea here is to practice thinking about what kinds of 
insights you can get from a dataset from asking questions about it.*/

SELECT item_name, price FROM superstore
ORDER BY price asc;

SELECT category, item_name, MAX(price) FROM superstore
GROUP BY "Kitchen Supplies";

SELECT stock_quantity, item_name FROM superstore WHERE item_name = "Air Purifier";

SELECT MAX(price), category, item_name FROM superstore
ORDER BY item_name;
